# Summary

`TorchSurv` (available on GitHub and PyPI) is a Python package that serves as a companion tool to perform deep survival modeling within the `PyTorch` environment [@paszke2019pytorch]. With its lightweight design, minimal input requirements, full `PyTorch` backend, and freedom from restrictive parameterizations, `TorchSurv` facilitates efficient deep survival model implementation and is particularly beneficial for high-dimensional and complex data scenarios.
`TorchSurv` has been rigorously tested using both open-source and synthetically generated survival data. The package is thoroughly documented and includes illustrative examples. The latest documentation for TorchSurv can be found on the[`TorchSurv`'s website](https://opensource.nibr.com/torchsurv/).

`TorchSurv` provides a user-friendly workflow for training and evaluating `PyTorch`-based deep survival models.
At its core, `TorchSurv` features `PyTorch`-based calculations of log-likelihoods for prominent survival models, including the Cox proportional hazards model [@Cox1972] and the Weibull Accelerated Time Failure (AFT) model [@Carroll2003].
In survival analysis, each observation is associated with survival reponse, denoted by $y$ (comprising the event indicator and the time-to-event or censoring), and covariates denoted by $x$. A survival model is parametrized by parameters, denoted by $\theta$. Within the `TorchSurv` framework, a `PyTorch`-based neural network is defined to act as a flexible function that takes the covariates $x$ as input and outputs the parameters $\theta$. Estimation of the parameters $\theta$ is achieved via maximum likelihood estimation facilitated by backpropagation. 
Additionally, `TorchSurv` offers evaluation metrics, including the time-dependent Area Under the cure (AUC) under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the Concordance index (C-index) and the Brier Score, to characterize the predictive performance of survival models.
Below is an overview of the workflow for model inference and evaluation with `TorchSurv`:

1. Initialize a `PyTorch`-based neural network that defines the function from the covariates $x$ to the parameters $\theta$. In the context of the Cox proportional hazards model for example, the parameters are the log relative hazards.
2. Initiate training: For each epoch on the training set,
    -  Draw survival response $y^{\text{train}}$ and covariates $x^{\text{train}}$ from the training set.
    - Obtain parameters $\theta^{\text{train}}$ given covariates $x^{\text{train}}$ using the neural network.
    - Calculate the loss as the negative log-likelihood of survival response $y^{\text{train}}$ given parameters $\theta^{\text{train}}$. This calculation is facilitated by `TorchSurv`'s loss function. 
    - Utilize backpropagation to update the neural network's parameters.
3. Obtain parameters $\theta^{\text{test}}$ given covariates from the test set $x^{\text{test}}$ using the trained neural network.
4. Evaluate the predictive performance of the model using `TorchSurv`'s evaluation metric functions given parameters $\theta^{\text{test}}$ and survival response from the test set $y^{\text{test}}$.



# Statement of need

Survival analysis plays a crucial role in various domains, such as medicine and engineering. Deep learning presents promising opportunities for developing sophisticated survival models, where the parameters depend on covariates through complex functions. However, no existing library provides the flexibility to define survival model parameters using a custom `PyTorch`-based neural network.

\autoref{tab:bibliography} compares the functionalities of `TorchSurv` with those of
`auton-survival` [@nagpal2022auton],
`pycox` [@Kvamme2019pycox],
`torchlife` [@torchlifeAbeywardana],
`scikit-survival` [@polsterl2020scikit],
`lifelines` [@davidson2019lifelines], and
`deepsurv` [@katzman2018deepsurv].
Existing libraries constrain users to predefined forms for defining the parameters (e.g., linear function of covariates). While there exist log-likelihood functions in the libraries, they cannot be leveraged.
Specifically, the limitations on the log-likelihood functions include protected functions, specialized input requirements (format or class type), and reliance on external libraries like `NumPy` or `Pandas`. Dependence on external libraries hinders automatic gradient calculation within `PyTorch`. Additionally, the implementation of likelihood functions instead of log-likelihood functions, as done by some packages, introduces numerical instability.
With respect to the evaluation metrics, `scikit-survival` stands out as a comprehensive library. However, it lacks certain desirable features, including confidence intervals and comparison of the evaluation metric between two different models, and it is implemented with `NumPy`. 
Our package, `TorchSurv`, is specifically designed for use in Python, but we also provide a comparative analysis of its functionalities with popular `R` packages for survival analysis in \autoref{tab:bibliography_R}. `R` packages also restrict users to specific forms to define the parameters and do not make log-likelihood functions readily accessible. However, `R` has extensive libraries for evaluation metrics, such as the `RiskRegression` library [@riskRegressionpackage]. `TorchSurv` offers a comparable range of evaluation metrics, ensuring comprehensive model evaluation regardless of the chosen programming environment. 

`TorchSurv`'s log-likelihood and evaluation metrics functions have undergone thorough comparison with benchmarks generated with Python packages and R packages on open-source data and synthetic data. High agreement between the outputs is consistently observed, providing users with confidence in the accuracy and reliability of `TorchSurv`'s functionalities. The comparison is presented in the [`TorchSurv`'s website](https://opensource.nibr.com/torchsurv/benchmarks.html).

For computing the concordance index, `pycox` requires the use of the estimated survival function as the risk score and does not support other types of time-dependent risk scores. `scikit-survival` does not support time-dependent risk scores in both the concordance index and AUC computation. Additionally, both `pycox` and `scikit-survival `impose the use of inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) for subject-specific weights. `scikit-survival` only offers the Breslow approximation of the Cox partial log-likelihood in case of ties in the event time, while it lacks the Efron approximation.\label{tab:bibliography}](table_1.png)

For obtaining the evaluation metrics, packages `survival`, `riskRegression`, `SurvMetrics` and `pec` require the fitted model object as input (a specific object format) and `RisksetROC` imposes a smoothing method. Packages `timeROC`, `riskRegression` and `pec` force the user to choose a form for subject-specific weights (e.g., inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW)). Packages `survcomp` and `SurvivalROC` do not implement the general AUC but the censoring-adjusted AUC estimator proposed by @Heagerty2000.\label{tab:bibliography_R}](table_2.png)


# Functionality

## Loss functions

**Cox loss function.** The Cox loss function is defined as the negative of the Cox proportional hazards model's partial log-likelihood [@Cox1972]. The function requires the subject-specific log relative hazards and the survival response (i.e., event indicator and time-to-event or censoring). The log relative hazards are obtained from a `PyTorch`-based model pre-specified by the user. In case of ties in the event times, the user can choose between the Breslow method [@Breslow1975] and the Efron method [@Efron1977] to approximate the Cox partial log-likelihood. We illustrate the use of the Cox loss function for a pseudo training loop in the code snippet below.

```python
from torchsurv.loss import cox
my_model = MyPyTorchCoxModel()  # PyTorch model outputs one (1) log hazards for Cox model

for data in dataloader:
    x, event, time = data  # covariate, event indicator, time
    log_hzs = my_model(x)  # torch.Size([64, 1]), if batch size is 64 
    loss = cox.neg_partial_log_likelihood(log_hzs, event, time)
    loss.backward()  # native torch backend
```

**Weibull loss function.** The Weibull loss function is defined as the negative of the Weibull AFT's log-likelihood [@Carroll2003]. The function requires the subject-specific log parameters of the Weibull distribution (i.e., the log scale and the log shape) and the survival response. The log parameters of the Weibull distribution should be obtained from a `PyTorch`-based model pre-specified by the user. We illustrate the use of the Weibull loss function for a pseudo training loop in the code snippet below.

```python
from torchsurv.loss import weibull
my_model = MyPyTorcWeibullhModel() # PyTorch model outputs two (2) log parameters for Weibull model

for data in dataloader:
    x, event, time = data  # covariate, event indicator, time
    log_params = my_model(x)  # torch.Size([64, 2]), if batch size is 64 
    loss = weibull.neg_log_likelihood(log_params, event, time)
    loss.backward()  # native torch backend
```

**Momentum**
 When training a model with a large file, the batch size is greatly limited by computational resources. This impacts the stability of model optimization, especially when rank-based loss is used. Inspired from MoCO [@he2020momentum], we implemented a momentum loss that decouples batch size from survival loss, increasing the effective batch size and allowing robust train of a model, even when using a very limited batch size (e.g., $\leq 16$). We illustrate the use of momentum for a pseudo training loop in the code
snippet below.

```python
from torchsurv.loss import Momentum
my_model = MyPyTorchXCoxModel()  # PyTorch model outputs one (1) log hazards for Cox model
my_loss = cox.neg_partial_log_likelihood  # Works with any TorchSurv loss
momentum = Momentum(backbone=my_model, loss=my_loss)

for data in dataloader:
    x, event, time = data # covariate, event indicator, time
    loss = model_momentum(x, event, time)  # torch.Size([16, 1])
    loss.backward()  # native torch backend

# Inference is computed with target network (k)
log_hzs = model_momentum.infer(x)  # torch.Size([16, 1])
```

## Evaluation Metrics Functions

The `TorchSurv` package offers a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate the predictive performance of survival models, including the AUC, C-index, and Brier score. The inputs of the evaluation metrics functions are the individual risk score estimated on the test set and the survival response on the test set. The risk score measures the risk (or a proxy thereof) that a subject has an event.  We provide definitions for each metric and demonstrate their use through illustrative code snippets.

**AUC.** The AUC measures the discriminatory capacity of a model at a given time $t$, i.e., the modelâs ability to provide a reliable ranking of times-to-event based on estimated individual risk scores [@Heagerty2005;@Uno2007;@Blanche2013].

```python
from torchsurv.metrics import Auc
auc = Auc()
auc(log_hzs, event, time)  # AUC at each time 
auc(log_hzs, event, time, new_time=torch.tensor(10.))  # AUC at time 10
```

**C-index.** The C-index is a generalization of the AUC that represents the assessment of the discriminatory capacity of the model across the time period [@Harrell1996;@Uno_2011].

```python
from torchsurv.metrics import ConcordanceIndex
cindex = ConcordanceIndex()
cindex(log_hzs, event, time)  # C-index
```

**Brier Score.** The Brier score evaluates the accuracy of a model at a given time $t$. It represents the average squared distance between the observed survival status and the predicted survival probability [@Graf_1999]. The Brier score cannot be obtained for the Cox proportional hazards model because the survival function is not available, but it can be obtained for the Weibull ATF model.

```python
from torchsurv.metrics import Brier
surv = survival_function(log_params, time) 
brier = Brier()
brier(surv, event, time)  # Brier score at each time
brier.integral()  # Integrated Brier score over time
```

**Additional features.** In `TorchSurv`, the evaluation metrics can be obtained for time-dependent and time-independent risk scores (e.g., for proportional and non-proportional hazards). Additionally, subjects can be optionally weighted (e.g., by the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW)).
Lastly, functionalities including the confidence interval, one-sample hypothesis test to determine whether the metric is better than that of a random predictor, and two-sample hypothesis test to compare two evaluation metrics between  different models are implemented. The following code snippet exemplifies the aforementioned functionalities for the C-index.

```python
cindex.confidence_interval()  # CI, default alpha = .05
cindex.p_value(alternative='greater')  # pvalue, H0: c = 0.5, HA: c > 0.5
cindex.compare(cindex_other)  # pvalue, H0: c1 = c2, HA: c1 > c2
```
