## Details

Final architecture analysis for `torchsurv`, focusing on its core components and their interactions. This analysis identifies the central modules and their responsibilities within the `torchsurv` project, outlining their relationships to provide a high-level data flow overview.

### Survival Loss Functions [[Expand]](./Survival_Loss_Functions.md)
This module provides a collection of loss functions specifically designed for training survival models. It includes implementations for common survival analysis objectives such as Cox proportional hazards, Weibull, and Momentum-based losses, enabling models to learn from censored and uncensored survival data.
