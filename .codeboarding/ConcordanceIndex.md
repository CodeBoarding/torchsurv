## Details

The `ConcordanceIndex` component is the primary focus, responsible for computing the Concordance Index (C-index) and related statistical analyses. It relies on an `Input Validation Utility` to ensure data integrity, although the exact source file for this utility is not directly identifiable as a distinct module. The `ConcordanceIndex` class explicitly calls validation functions within its `__call__` method. These two components are fundamental: the `ConcordanceIndex Calculator` directly implements the C-index computation, while the `Input Validation Utility` ensures data quality, preventing errors and ensuring accuracy. The `ConcordanceIndex Calculator` uses the `Input Validation Utility` to validate its inputs.

### ConcordanceIndex Calculator [[Expand]](./ConcordanceIndex_Calculator.md)
This component is the central entity responsible for computing the Concordance Index (C-index). It encapsulates the complex algorithms for C-index calculation, including handling tied risk scores and incorporating Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW) for censored data. Beyond basic computation, it provides functionalities for statistical analysis, such as calculating confidence intervals (using Noether, Bootstrap, or Conservative methods) and p-values, and enabling comparisons between different C-index values.

### Input Validation Utility
This component provides essential utility functions for validating the input data (estimate, event, and time) before they are processed by the `ConcordanceIndex Calculator`. Its role is to ensure that the data types, shapes, and general structure conform to the expected format, thereby preventing errors and ensuring the robustness of the C-index computation. While not a standalone class in the `torchsurv.tools` module as initially assumed, its functions (`validate_survival_data`, `validate_estimate`) are crucial for the correct operation of the `ConcordanceIndex Calculator`.
